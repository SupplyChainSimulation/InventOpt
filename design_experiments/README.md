## Exhaustive evaluation 

After estimating the computation budget, we run the simulation model with fixed points (configured using *in_param.csv* input file) in design space to obtain data *'supplychain_datav2_L_N.csv'*. 
The *data* directory contains a sample file named _in_params.csv_, which lists all points in the sample space of the input parameters for which the simulation will be executed.

The *output* directory contains sample output files (such as _supplychain_datav2_30_50.csv_) after running the Python script.
