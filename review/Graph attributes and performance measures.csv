Supply Chain Network Graph Attributes,,
Sr,Attribute/Feature,Description
1,Number of nodes,Total nodes in the network
2,Number of edges,Total links in the network
3,Type of SC,Type of supply chain
4,Network resilience,Resilience of the network depends on the node and edge resilience
5,Availability,Supply availability rate (the percentage of demand nodes that have access to supplies)
6,Connectivity,Size of the largest functional subnetwork (where there is a path between any two pairs and there exists at least one supplier)
7,Accessibility,Metric depends on supply path length (supplier to consumer)
8,Node complexity,Total number of nodes
9,Flow complexity,"Total number of forward, backward, and within-tier material flow"
10,Density,Geographical spacing of nodes within a supply chain
11,Density variance,Variance among the densities of the clusters
12,Supplier complexity,Percent of nodes that are suppliers in the supply chain network
13,Node criticality,Percentage of critical nodes (nodes that could cut main flow when down)

Supply Chain Network Graph Performance Measures,,
Sr,Performance Measure,Description
1,Supply chain cost,The overall cost of the supply chain in a given time period/time unit (month/quarter/half year/year)
2,Average SC cost,Average supply chain cost per time unit (daily/monthly/quarterly)
3,Supply chain net profit,Net revenue generated by the supply chain in a given time period
4,Average SC net profit,Average net revenue generated by SC per time unit
5,Customer service level,What percent of demand was met in a given time period
6,Resilience level,Resilience of the networkÿ
