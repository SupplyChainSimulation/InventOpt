### Prerequisites 

You'll need to install [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) before you proceed to run the Python scripts in this directory.

Run _Data_Visualizer_ori.py_ using the following command in your terminal.
    
        streamlit run Data_Visualizer_ori.py

We have developed an app that allows visualization of multidimensional data as 3D slices. You can select two axes at a time and set value ranges for the other axes. The app is published and freely available on Streamlit. See the details below.

A simple tool to visualize samples of a vector function over a multi-dimensional space.
